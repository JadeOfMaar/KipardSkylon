	description = Liquid Air Cycle Engine is a feature of some precoolers where the intake air is flash-cooled either by the liquid Helium cooling loop, or by expendable liquid Hydrogen fuel, into liquid forms for the liquid Oxygen which is then fed into the engine to help save on Oxidizer launch weight. Skylon originally does not need this but in the case that it is needed, it is prepared.
