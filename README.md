## Main Features
* 5m diameter at the midsection. Its Payload Bay comfortably holds 2.5m or tightly holds 3.75m.
* Runs on Hydrolox (not LFO) by default: SABRE, OMS/tail engine, Payload Bay's builtin fuel cell and RCS.
* Balanced for 2.7x ~ 3.2x scaled systems. Rated for 30 tons to 1000km in 2.7x with its own bay.
* Drone core contains 4 control points: Forward, Up (Docking), SABRE thrust vector, OMS thrust vector.
* Precoolers each create up to 200 Oxidizer per second between Mach 1.2 ~ 6.
* Shock cones animate if **B9AnimationModules** mod is installed.
* SABRE (as per true turborocket nature) sips on Oxidizer in air-breating mode which explains its enduring power in higher atmosphere than most other jet engines.
* Aerodynamics stats thoroughly tested but there's always the inherent issue of the center of lift being under the center of mass due to the wing placement.

## Bonus Features
* Added custom cargo bay for use as a service bay. Can comfortably hold 3.75m and can provide a wide selection of inner node clusters for mounting useful 1.25m things.
* Can sweat Liquid Hydrogen for thermal control/transpiration.
* Includes reconfigured, recolored stock wheels to fit its profile.
