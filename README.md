Originally made and released (open alpha) in December 2014 by kerbal forum user **CaptainKipard** who last appeared mid-2016.
## Main Features
* 5m diameter at the midsection. Its Payload Bay comfortably holds 2.5m or tightly holds 3.75m.
* Runs on Hydrolox (not LFO) by default: SABRE, OMS/tail engine, Payload Bay's builtin fuel cell and RCS.
* Balanced for 2.7x ~ 3.2x scaled systems. Rated for 30 tons to 1000km in 2.7x with its own bay.
* Drone core contains 4 control points: Forward, Up (Docking), SABRE thrust vector, OMS thrust vector.
* Precoolers each create up to 200 Oxidizer per second between Mach 1.2 ~ 6.
* Shock cones animate if **B9AnimationModules** mod is installed.
* SABRE (as per true turborocket nature) sips on Oxidizer in air-breating mode which explains its enduring power in higher atmosphere than most other jet engines.
* Aerodynamics stats thoroughly tested but there's always the inherent issue of the center of lift being under the center of mass due to the wing placement.

## Bonus Features
* Added custom cargo bay for use as a service bay. Can comfortably hold 3.75m and can provide a wide selection of inner node clusters for mounting useful 1.25m things.
* Can sweat Liquid Hydrogen for thermal control/transpiration.
* Includes reconfigured, recolored stock wheels to fit its profile.

### Dependencies

* Community Resource Pack

### Integrations
* B9 Animation Modules
* WBI Classic Stock

### Issues
Some lasting issues that I've discovered in the process of this takeover include: A drag cube problem with the largest tank pieces.I am not sure if they can be properly fixed. Until then these tanks had an extra stack node added to them and must receive a 3.75m nose cone there. Feel free to hide (but do not scale down) the cones afterward; The pre-made wheels run on Firespitter but misbehave even with the current version of Firespitter (as at KSP 1.8.1). While these remain unusuable I have supplied customized stock wheels to use in their place.
